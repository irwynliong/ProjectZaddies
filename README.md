Project description: We decided to do a payment solution integrated into a POS system that aims to streamline supply-chain management and reconciliation for merchants selling consignment goods.
For our system, weâ€™ve created our own ERC20 token called PandaTokens.
Our goal is to make consigned goods an instant settlement after being sold, easing the end-of-month settlements. This also provides an avenue for transparency and improve trust between consignor and consignee.
